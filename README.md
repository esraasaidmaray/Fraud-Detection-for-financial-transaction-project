# Fraud-Detection-for-financial-transaction-project
This repository contains an NLP-based fraud detection for financial transactions system using machine learning techniques to analyze and classify fraudulent activities
Week 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
• Tasks:
o Data Collection: Obtain financial transaction data, including labeled
fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
o Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, addressing missing
values and normalizing features.
o Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy).
• Deliverables:
o Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
o Data preprocessing notebook.
Week 2: Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning
• Tasks:
o Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical analysis to understand the distribution
of fraud-related features.
o Machine Learning: Develop and evaluate classification models for fraud
detection (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
o Tools: Python (Scikit-learn, Statsmodels).
• Deliverables:
o Statistical analysis report.
o Fraud detection models and performance metrics.
Week 3: Advanced Techniques and Azure Integration
• Tasks:
o NLP for Transaction Notes: Apply NLP techniques to analyze transaction
descriptions or notes.
o Azure AI Fundamentals: Deploy the fraud detection model using Azure
Machine Learning or Azure Synapse.
o Tools: Azure Machine Learning, Python (NLTK, SpaCy).
• Deliverables:
o Enhanced fraud detection model with NLP integration.
o Deployment setup on Azure.
Week 4: MLOps, GANs, and Final Presentation
• Tasks:
o MLOps: Use MLflow to manage and track fraud detection models.
o GANs for Synthetic Data: Implement a GAN to generate synthetic fraud
transaction data for training and validation.
o Final Report and Presentation: Document the project including data
analysis, model development, and deployment.
o Tools: MLflow, Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch for GANs), Azure services.
• Deliverables:
o Deployed fraud detection model with synthetic data.
o Final report and presentation
